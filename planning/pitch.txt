As mentioned in the beginning of this project, you have some questions to ask yourself:

    👨‍💻 Solo
    What do I want to build? Karaoke Web Application
    How do I want to build it?
    Is it possible to build it in less than 2 weeks? No
    Do I like what I’m doing? Love it

When you know these answers, you will have to prepare a pitch:

    Max 10min of pitch (please repeat to not go over)
    Google slide presentation with:
        Name of the project
        List of team members
        Description of the project
        Learning objectives
        Technologies used
        Third services used if applicable
        Challenges already identified
        Schedule of work (by using Trello or Kanban board or other) - don’t forget that you have less then 4 weeks (27 days exactly)
        Mock-ups if applicable
    Video Recording of one or more team members presenting the pitch (using the Google Slide presentation)

Please post your slides and the recording to your web-stack portfolio pitch here.

Let’s do it! 💪
